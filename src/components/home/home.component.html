  Chess is a classic game that was created in India during the 6th century. The core goal of the game is to put the opponents "king" piece in check. Meaning that it is not able to move without being captured by one of the opponents pieces.
  Our version is another classic take on chess, with the addition of leveled AI to allow a player to enjoy the game by themselves at different difficulties.
